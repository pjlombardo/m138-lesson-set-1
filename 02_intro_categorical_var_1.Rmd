Before beginning, let's get used to loading the `R` packages we might need for analysis later.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
The `tidyverse` is actually a collection of packages that all work well together, and it includes functions for data wrangling, plotting, and much more!  We will learn to use the tidyverse well this semester.

# Exploring and Summarizing Categorical Variables

Let's work with our titanic data set again.  Can you remember how to load this CSV file as a data frame in R?
```{r}
# Place your code here, or use the import data set button.
```

The `table()` command is a quick way to have `R` create tables of counts for categorical variables.  For example, the `Survived` variable in our titantic data set is a categorical variable (a "factor") with two "levels":

  * Yes (indicating that person survived); and
  * No (indicating that person died).

Run the following command to count how many people survived.
```{r}
table(titanic$Survived)
```

How many survived?

#### Exercise 1:
How many females were on board the titanic according to this data set?
```{r}
#place your code here.
```


#### Exercise 2:
What *percentage* of the passengers on board were male?
```{r}
#place your code here.

```


#### Exercise 3:
Let's look into using `prop.table()` and the "piping operator", `%>%`.
```{r}
# place your code here.

```

## Contingency tables for *two* categorical variables
We can create "contingency tables" (or cross tabs, there are many names) by passing two variables into the `table()` command.  Run the following code:
```{r}
table(titanic$Survived, titanic$Gender)

# or the "piped" approach
titanic %>%
    select(Survived, Gender) %>%
    table()
```

*Note*: whichever variable is "selected" first will appear as the rows, the second variable appears as the columns.


#### Exercise 3:
Explain what each number in the table counts; be specific and describe how the row and column labels tell you this information.

#### Exercise 4:
Using `R` as a calculator, use the numbers in the table above to compute the survival rate for men and the survival rate for women. 

*Note*: the survival rate for men would be the percentage *of the males* that survived. 
```{r}
#place your code here
```

Which `Sex` had the higher survival rate?

We can compute row or column percentages quickly by passing a table into the `prop.table()` command in choosing a `margin`.

Try this code:
```{r}
titanic %>% 
    select(Gender, Survived) %>% 
    table() %>%
    prop.table(margin =1)
```

#### Exercise 5:
Answer the following questions:

* What happens if you set `margin = 2`?
    * What happens if you do not specify a "margin" at all?

* Using a similar command as above, find the percentage of those that survived who were female.

```{r}
# place your code here.
```
